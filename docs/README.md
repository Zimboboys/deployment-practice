# SMERN

> that's "serverless MERN" put together

## What is it?

These docs are a somewhat comprehensive guide to getting a MERN app into
production in a reasonably cheap way (especially if you're not expecting
tons of traffic). You're still going to have to put things together in the
right way, but this should make deployment more straightforward.

Head over to [the overview](overview.md) to get started.

## Features

- the frontend uses AWS Amplify
- the backend uses API Gateway/Lambda
- both allow for automated and continuous deployments
- these make use of AWS's "pay-for-what-you-use" model

## Feedback

These docs definitely aren't perfect. Let me know where you had trouble and
I'll try and clear it up!
